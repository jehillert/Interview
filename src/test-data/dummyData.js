Jesse even went above and beyond his duty to assist me with knowledge explanations, and most importantly resources. As this is my first experience as a single mother, I was hesitant assuming the worst, he proved me wrong! He was great and I have already begun to refer. Thank you, Jesse. My children and I appreciate you very much!",

Being such a young buyer I was worried I was in over my head especially since my father (the man in my life who had all the answers) just passed away in march due to the virus. After I told him my story he stepped in to help me with every question I had no matter how stupid it was. And I know that if I was to ever purchase another house or know someone who is going to buy a house I will definitely recommend Tony. ",

Spend less time looking to shift blame, spend more time patiently looking for solutions to move to the next step. Don't automatically assume it's over and the borrower won't qualify. Don't be sarcastic when someone tells you that they're upset with your attitude. Most importantly, do NOT title an email \"YOUR LOAN\". You are clearly inferring to kiss the ring or be denied.",

We would recommend Will and Crown Home Mortgage to anyone looking to buy a home, especially if they are unfamiliar with the process.",

It seems she was always verrry busy with other customers and didn't give me 'preferred' customer service that every customer expects.   But in her defense, she tried her best under the circumstances with covid and a power outage that she had.   It seems like the underwriter should have done his job a lot quicker and Jessica should have been on top of that.   Overall 8 of 10.",

She was not only genuine, but very realistic about the whole process. She was always available to answer my questions and was always sure to move the application along as quickly as she could. Highly recommend!",

He never made me feel silly for asking or uncomfortable for asking.  He seemed to genuinely care that I understood the entire process and that I did everything that I needed to do!  I highly recommend him and would refer him to anyone and everyone!",

This time around in the refinance, our family home sold, very little debt and credit scores over 800, we were forced to jump through hoops to make it happen.  It should have been easier as all necessary info and paperwork was provided one year earlier.  Michael is a gentleman and does his job extremely well.",

        "Review": "Rich is by far one of the best I have ever worked with. He jumped in and got us to where we needed to be very quickly. We communicated on a regular basis and he helped to resolve whatever issues we ran into expediently. I will highly recommend Rich to anyone that requires his services and I look forward to working with Rich in the future.",

When the process was started, the refinance rate was going up and down and I asked for Dan's advice and he said NOT to wait any longer and lock on the rate and he promised to lower the rate if goes down significantly.  Thank God I listened to Dan and the rate never went down and we were able to close the process on the rate which we agreed on. The whole process was finished in 30 days. :)\nI am already recommending Dan to couple of my friends. ",

There was delay in my refi due to paperwork they needed however title company had it the entire time, which was why it was so delayed, so I’m my opinion, I shouldn’t have been responsible for my March payment.

Mortgages are stressful, and have never ending requests for paperwork.Finally, your at the end of the tunnel with a date to close, to start over would be unthinkable. People Just sign even though they are not getting what was promised. Thank goodness for once. I stopped. I started all over with George. All he promised was happily received! Thanks George!!!",

The first time was a new mortgage and this time was a refinance and both times he was a pleasure to work with, I would highly recommend him. He was always available when I had questions and took his time to explain everything which made the whole re finance process seamless.\nI had also recommended Will to my son and he had the same excellent experience. Thank you again Will for your knowledge and professionalism!!",

Rarely did I have to ask for clarification during the process which is polar opposite from the last bank I dealt with. The process was quick once I made up my mind. The appraisal company left a bad taste in my mouth but that wasn’t Paula’s fault.",

She gave me an option to purchase the first rate and it cost $7000 more to get what I had been originally promised. I transferred the money from my downpayment which extended my escrow and my moving date (horrible domino effect). \n\nWorst of all she led me to believe that my HOA would be part of my mortgage. Now I am screwed paying $450/month more",

She and her team were patient and responsive as I worked thru the steps in a very difficult year.  At times I know I had questions that were repetitive and specific and she listened and responded.  The documents prepared were professional and complete, which made the process quicker than was estimated.",

Truthfully, he helps with every single little step of the process without ever feeling like you are being burdened and inundated with hassle and paperwork. He makes the process so seamless, it’s almost fun. We won’t ever shop for a mortgage again. Thanks again Cory. You are amazing! \n",

He reacts quickly to any questions or concerns that I may have along the way and keeps things moving along.  For this latest re-finance, he proactively reached out to me when rates had gotten to a favorable position for my situation.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jonathan for anyone re-financing a home.",

In our experience, big banks complicate the issue where not necessary, versus the amazing attention you get at AHMC. Jesse's no-nonsense approach is refreshing. He reassured us that he was not there to point out any issues but instead to come up with the solutions. We will certainly be using him for future loans as well and we highly recommend him.

I am so thankful we choose CJ as our loan processor and have already referred close friends and family to him.",

To my great surprise, AHMC was the ONLY company who actually (a) returned phone calls; (b) told the truth and kept to their word, and (c) did not try to \"bait & switch\" the way two of the largest mortgage companies in the country did.  It really is amazing that little things like telling the truth and returning phone call are so difficult to find today.  So glad that Mr. Jones possesses both of these rare qualities.",
